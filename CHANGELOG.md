### What's Changed

- New Contributors Page: Created a new page at /contributors to showcase all project contributors.
- GitHub API Integration: The page dynamically fetches and displays code contributors using the official GitHub API, ensuring the list is always up-to-date.
- Design Contributors Section: A dedicated section has been added to manually feature design contributors, including their name, avatar, and a link to their portfolio.
